# tango_with_django_project
Hi, didn't realize I need to commit every chapter until I finished all 10 chapters, so have to re-create these previous commits, might not be correct.
#The coursework is based on the e-book "Tango with Django2: A Beginner's Guide to Web Development", by Leif Azzopardi and David Maxwell, published by Lean Publishing (henceforth "TWD")â€“ specifically the version that says "2020-01a" on the cover. The latest version has been updated for Django 2.2.
